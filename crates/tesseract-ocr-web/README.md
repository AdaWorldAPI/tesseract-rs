# tesseract-ocr-web

A single-binary web demo for the pure-Rust Tesseract transcode. Upload an image
(or paste an image URL), the server runs the recognizer and returns the text
plus stats, with a one-click `.txt` download.

**The selling point:** OCR with **zero C libraries at runtime** — no
libtesseract, no leptonica, no OpenCV. Image decode (PNG/JPEG/PNM) and TLS
(rustls + bundled webpki roots) are pure Rust too, so the Docker image is just
the glibc-linked binary and ~4 MB of `eng` model data.

## Stack

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP | `axum` 0.7 (+ multipart) | Tower ecosystem, typed extractors |
| Templates | `askama` 0.12 | Compile-time-checked HTML, no runtime engine |
| Runtime | `tokio` | Async, single binary |
| Image decode | `image` 0.25 (png/jpeg/pnm) | Pure Rust, no C deps |
| URL fetch | `reqwest` 0.12 (rustls) | rustls only — never openssl |
| Body cap | `tower-http` `RequestBodyLimitLayer` | 12 MB upload ceiling |
| OCR | `tesseract-ocr` + `tesseract-core` | The pure-Rust recognizer |

## Run locally

The model lives in the repo at `corpus/model`. From the repo root:

```sh
# Binds 0.0.0.0:$PORT; PORT defaults to 8080 for local dev.
cargo run -p tesseract-ocr-web
# → open http://localhost:8080

# Custom port / model dir:
PORT=3000 MODEL_DIR=/path/to/model cargo run -p tesseract-ocr-web
```

- **`file`** upload wins over a **`url`** when both are given.
- The result page shows image size, character/line counts, and recognition
  time, plus a **Download .txt** link (a `data:` URI, no temp files).

## Ports — `$PORT`, not hardcoded

The binary reads `PORT` from the environment and binds `0.0.0.0:$PORT`. `8080`
is **only** the local-dev fallback. On Railway, **Railway injects `PORT`
itself** — so it is deliberately not set in the Dockerfile or `railway.toml`.
Don't add `ENV PORT=...`; it would shadow Railway's value.

## Security — the URL arm is SSRF-guarded

Fetching a user-supplied URL is an SSRF vector, so `fetch_image_url`:

1. allows **http/https only**;
2. resolves the host and **rejects any non-public IP** — loopback, private
   (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16), link-local incl. `169.254.169.254` (cloud
   metadata), ULA `fc00::/7`, v6 link-local `fe80::/10`, unspecified — with
   v4-mapped-v6 unwrapped;
3. **disables redirects** (a 3xx could bounce past the guard);
4. caps the download at **10 MB / 10 s** (content-length pre-check + a hard
   streaming cap so a lying/omitted length can't OOM the process).

## Tests

```sh
cargo test -p tesseract-ocr-web
```

Covers the base64 download encoder (RFC 4648 vectors), the SSRF blocklist on
literal IPs, non-http scheme rejection, a real corpus-page OCR (`page_01.pgm`
→ contains "clock"), and a `GET /` 200 via `tower`'s `oneshot`. Tests that need
the model skip gracefully if `corpus/model` is absent.

## Deploy on Railway

Railway clones a single repo, but this crate's path deps escape it:

```
tesseract-core       → ../../../lance-graph/crates/lance-graph-contract
tesseract-recognizer → ../../../ndarray
```

so the **builder stage fetches those two siblings itself** — everything ends up
in one binary. It just needs a token that can read the private repos, which is
exactly the access Railway's GitHub login already grants you:

- **Railway:** add a build variable `GH_TOKEN` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN`) set to that
  token. Railway exposes service variables at build time, so the Dockerfile
  reads it directly — no per-repo wiring, no submodules. Railway auto-detects
  `railway.toml` and builds `crates/tesseract-ocr-web/Dockerfile`.
- Optionally pin the siblings with `LANCE_GRAPH_REF` / `NDARRAY_REF` build args
  (default = each repo's default branch, matching CI).

### Local Docker build

```sh
# From the repo root, with BuildKit and a token in $GH_TOKEN:
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build \
  -f crates/tesseract-ocr-web/Dockerfile \
  --secret id=gh_token,src=<(printf %s "$GH_TOKEN") \
  -t ocr-web .

docker run --rm -e PORT=8080 -p 8080:8080 ocr-web
# → http://localhost:8080
```

The `GH_TOKEN` build arg also works (`--build-arg GH_TOKEN=...`), but it is
baked into the (discarded) builder layer; prefer the BuildKit secret. The final
runtime image never contains the token or the source — only the binary + model.

## Routes

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | Upload/URL form |
| `POST` | `/ocr` | Multipart `file` or `url` → result page |
